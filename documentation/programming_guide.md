# Programming Guide
Welcome to this programing guide. This file is new and needs some refinement. Maybe, migrate to the wiki...

Colors
------

To use colors, simply have this "0x0F" (no quotes) in the end of print() statement. Example:
print("I am text", 0x0F);

The colors can be customized as needed. But first, understanding the anatomy of the color code is important (Need refinements). The part that we are going to look at is the last 2 Hexadecimal digit. The first one will tell the terminal to color the background (In the example, the background will be black). The second will tell the terminal to color the text (In the example, white). Here is the color codes:

0: Black
1: Blue
2: Green
3: Grey
4: Red
5: Purple
6: Brown?
7: Light Grey
8: Dark Grey
9: Lighter Blue
A: Green?
B: Cyan
C: Bright Red
D: Magenta
E: Yellow/ Green (I have color blind some one fix this...)
F: White
