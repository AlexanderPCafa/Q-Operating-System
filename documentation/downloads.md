# Try Q OS Without Downloading Source Files

If you came here because you just want to try out Q OS without having to do complex compiling or setup on your computer, this page has exactly waht you are looking for.

## Download the latest <code>Q-OS.iso</code>

If you want to try Q OS inside a virtual machine or burn it to a CD/USB, click [here](https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B6wT3i4cCDb_T1RodV9qQ05TZHM). That link will take you to a Google Drive file download page which should always have the most recent Q OS <code>.iso</code> file. If it isn't the most recent, that is because the latest version has errors that prevent it from working or cause major bugs. If you are very brave and want to try buggy versions, have a look at [this file](https://github.com/raphydaphy/Q-Operating-System/blob/master/compiling.md) for some instructions on how to compile the code for Q OS on your own computer.

## Download versions of Q OS older than the latest release

If you are interested in trying ancient versions of Q OS, we have mae some downloads avalable for every GitHub release of Q OS, as in version 0.01, 0.02 and so on. You can get them by going to the [Q OS Releases](https://github.com/raphydaphy/Q-Operating-System/releases/) page on GitHub, or clicking that link. Just choose the version of Q OS you want to download in the sidebar and you can download it in <code>.iso</code>, <code>.zip</code> or <code>.tar.gz</code> format.
